### 2. Storage and Organization
-Resource separation:
-	/Image/ stores all images, further divided by purpose (Imperial, News, People, Research).
-Page grouping:
-	YapLab.htm serves as the main landing page with navigation.
-	/Research/ stores all detailed research subpages, each linked from the homepage.
-Naming convention:
-	Research pages follow research-[block]-[sub](Topic).htm format for clarity.
-	Images follow block-index.png for quick correspondence with research modules.
