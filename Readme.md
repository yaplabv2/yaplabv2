2. Storage and Organization
	Resource separation:
	•	/Image/ stores all images, further divided by purpose (Imperial, News, People, Research).
	Page grouping:
	•	YapLab.htm serves as the main landing page with navigation.
	•	/Research/ stores all detailed research subpages, each linked from the homepage.
	Naming convention:
	•	Research pages follow research-[block]-[sub](Topic).htm format for clarity.
	•	Images follow block-index.png for quick correspondence with research modules.

3. Modules in YapLab (Main Page)

YapLab.htm is the central hub and includes:
	1.	Navigation (Nav bar)
	•	Links: Research, Code & Dataset, People, Publications, Openings.
	2.	Hero Section
	•	Lab branding and mission statement
	•	Research focus chips (Biomechanics Simulation, AI, Ultrasound, etc.)
	•	News carousel (lab highlights, awards, press releases)
	•	Metrics (Publications, Open-source codes, Patents, Students)
	3.	Research Section
	•	High-level research blocks (Machine Learning, Echocardiography, Fetal Heart, Embryonic Heart, Blood Pump, Hemostatic Materials, Placenta).
	•	Each block has “mini cards” linking to detailed /Research/ pages.
	4.	People Section
	•	Faculty profile (PI with photo, titles, homepage link).
	•	Lab members grid (photos, role, research focus, contact info).
	5.	Publications Section
	•	Publications organized by year, with a dropdown for quick navigation.
	•	Each item lists title, authors, journal/conference, and external link.
	6.	Openings Section
	•	Recruitment info (PhD, Postdoc, Visiting Scientist).
	•	Contact link with pre-filled email subject.
	7.	Footer
	•	Copyright notice.
	•	Contact email.

4. Modules in Research Folder
